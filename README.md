# Summarify - AI PDF Summarizer


Summarify is a full-stack AI web application that allows users to **upload any PDF**, process its content with **AI-powered summarization**, and interact with it using **natural language questions**. Unlike most AI tools that only accept plain text, Gistify is designed to **intelligently read and understand complex PDF files**, including research papers, reports, legal documents, and more.

## üß† Why Summarify?

> "Most AI tools fail to handle PDFs natively ‚Äî I built Summarify to bridge that gap."

- While chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini often require manual copy-pasting, Summarify **extracts content directly from uploaded PDFs**, processes it into chunks, stores embeddings, and enables **contextual interactions**.
- Ideal for **students**, **lawyers**, **researchers**, and **analysts** who regularly work with large documents.
